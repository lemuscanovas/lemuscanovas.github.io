* Land use:
On slight terrace bordered on S and W by Ebro valley. Ebro River is ~2km away. Station sits on field in front of small building (49m away). WNW: a hill of 3ft height. Wind sensors are placed on metal tower over building to 10m above ground level.
* Soil type:

* Surface coverage:
Grass
* History:
The Observatory was established in 1905 by the Jesuit congregation. It is placed on a little hill, at 50 m above the sea level. No great location changes has been detected since then. <br> Until 1982 this observatory used a different method than the current for calculating the precipitation intensity, so there are very large rainfall intensities. Previously calculated with the tangent to the curve and is now calculated with the secant. <br> For most of the period, cloud cover was expressed originaly as tenths of covered sky. <br> Wind speed obtained as average total run of wind, from 07h to 07h through a mechanical counter (Robinson cup anemometer).
